Given the distinction between subjective and objective styles of observation described in the essay "4D Holons and choice", a key question is how these dynamics alter when holons exchanging information are of very different scales. Consider tthe interplay between multiple team members seeking to accoplish a complex task. At the smallest level of organization, we have individual team members for the duration of their individual flow experiences. These units of measure may themselves be ambiguous, as a typicla flow experience can be more or less intense. It is certainly true that a human experiencing flow does have some interaction with the environment and thus, is only ever partially in a state of superposition. The degree to which an individual flow experience is 'broken up' by effects like being observed or forming memories itself creates a 'sliding scale' of larger and smaller, more or less intense flow experiences for the person in question. The individual 'starts and stops' of consciousness that caracterise everyday experience are presumably identical in quality. It is only in scale that the holons of the everyday differ from the holons of flow, with probabilities changing nonlinearly as the holons increase in scale. 
If we extedn our investigation beyond the narrow focus of a sporting event - say to a group of co-workers pursuing a flow-inducing goal over a period of months - then these 'local' holons, personal and group both, are embedded within one or more larger holons. To what degree the same kind of consciousness which characterises holons in a neural net over a short time period can extend to such larger campaigns, with their starts and stops, is an intriguing question. We may presume that this dynamic follows the same tradeoffs we see at local scales, with a lower 'density' of consciousness commensurate with its greater 'size'. 
Three or four distinct scales are thus relevant in considering the dynamics of human consciousness as four dimensional holons. At the intrahuman scale, individual complexes within the human neural network exchange information across short time spans. These smaller units of consciousness are likely more intense but less meaningful than the large narratives composed mostly of memory and prediction that make up everyday experience. Extending a smaller number of possible states through a laonger time characterises flow experience, with access to less likely outcomes becoming possible. Being of a higher dimension, the 4D mind increases in size faster than its 3D 'surface', or observations.
