Given the distinction between subjective and objective styles of observation described in the essay "4D Holons and choice", a key question is how these dynamics alter when holons exchanging information are of very different scales. Consider tthe interplay between multiple team members seeking to accoplish a complex task. At the smallest level of organization, we have individual team members for the duration of their individual flow experiences. These units of measure may themselves be ambiguous, as a typicla flow experience can be more or less intense. It is certainly true that a human experiencing flow does have some interaction with the environment and thus, is only ever partially in a state of superposition. The degree to which an individual flow experience is 'broken up' by effects like being observed or forming memories itself creates a 'sliding scale' of larger and smaller, more or less intense flow experiences for the person in question. The individual 'starts and stops' of consciousness that caracterise everyday experience are presumably identical in quality. It is only in scale that the holons of the everyday differ from the holons of flow, with probabilities changing nonlinearly as the holons increase in scale.
